## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Cursor IDE
- GitHub account
- Vercel account
- uv (Python package manager)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (set as an environment variable in Vercel)
- Optional: Vercel CLI (only if deploying from terminal):
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  ```
---

# Build 🏗️

In this session, you'll build a Python FastAPI backend called Hot Mess Coach, add an LLM chat endpoint, optionally add document analysis (PDF/CSV), and deploy to Vercel. Advanced: generate a frontend in v0 and connect it to your backend.

- 🤝 [Breakout Room](./BreakoutRoom.md)
    - Add GitFlow and Cursor rules
    - Create GitHub repo
    - Add a FastAPI backend
    - Run locally
    - Deploy the backend to Vercel

- 🤝 [Assignment](./Assignment.md)
    - Set up environment and create FastAPI
    - Add extra features
    - Test locally and deploy to Vercel
    - Advanced: generate a frontend in v0, connect to backend, deploy frontend

# Ship 🚢

The deployed Hot Mess Coach backend on Vercel (and optional frontend connected to it)!

Our deployed Vercel applications are here: 
1. https://aim-hot-mess-coach.vercel.app/
   with GitHub repo available here: https://github.com/katgaw/AIM-hot-mess-coach
2. https://aim-hot-mess-coach-upload.vercel.app/

<summary>🚧 Advanced Modules (OPTIONAL) — <i>open for details</i></summary>

**Advanced Backend:**
- Add PDF/CSV uploads and structured analysis
- Implement chunking utilities for long documents
- Iterate locally, then re-deploy

**Advanced Frontend (v0):**
- Generate a frontend with v0 that calls your backend (`POST /chat`)
- Connect via fetch and deploy the frontend to Vercel

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - Your deployed backend (and optional frontend) showcasing the features you built
  - A walkthrough of your GitFlow + multi-agent workflow
  - Your advanced module (doc analysis/chunking or v0 frontend)

🚀 Exciting News! 🚀

I am thrilled to announce that I have just built and deployed a modern web application using AI-powered development tools! 🎉🤖

🔍 Three Key Takeaways:

1️⃣ AI tools like v0.dev can generate complete frontend applications from natural language prompts

2️⃣ GitFlow and feature branching enable parallel development workflows

3️⃣ Modern CI/CD with Vercel makes deployment seamless and automatic

Let's continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of AI-assisted development. Here's to many more innovations! 🚀
